# PasswordValidation
This project is a password validation tool that checks if a password is strong enough. The user enters a password in a text input field, and the tool evaluates it based on three criteria: minimum length of 10 characters, presence of letters and numbers, and presence of special characters.
If the password meets all three criteria, the tool displays a message "You have a very good password". If it meets only two of the criteria, the message will be "You have a good password". If it meets only one or none of the criteria, the message will be "You have a weak password".
The tool updates the message in real-time as the user types or modifies the password. If the user deletes the password, the message prompts the user to enter a password. The tool is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
